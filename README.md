# crop-growth-stage-prediction
This project aims to predict the growth stage of crops using various environmental factors such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The models included are implemented using different machine learning algorithms: TensorFlow (Deep Learning), scikit-learn (Traditional ML), and RandomForest.
